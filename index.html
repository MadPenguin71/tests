                <p style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 20px; padding-right: 10px;"">All Elite Wrestling has grown vastly since its inception. With hundreds of different talent having come through the organization, the company has seen its fair share of greatness. Legends of the industry like Sting, or the young lions of tomorrow like Wheeler Yuta. Throughout the companys run, four men have held their positions of the young pillars of the company.</p>

        <div id="containerwhitethree">
            <div class="whitetextone"> <h3>Darby Allin</h3> First, we have Darby Allin. An extreme risk-taker, his wrestling style has been long compared to Jeff Hardy for good reason. With high-impact stunts, and a thirst for broken bones whether its his opponents or his own, Allin has quickly taken the mantle of risk taker from Jeff and ran with it. The only thing more captivating than Allin's fighting style is his persona. Covering half of his face in facepaint similar to wrestling legend Sting, Allin has successfully taken the legends place in wrestling. A mysterious, dangerous man often on the side of good. As a former TNT champion, Allin has already shown that he's capable of something greater. It's just remained to be seen whether or not his body can hold up as he reaches new heights, figurativly as well as literally.</div>
            <div class="whitetexttwo"> <h3>Maxwell Jacob Friedman (MJF)</h3> What is left to be said about MJF that hasn't already been said? "Scum of the Earth" has been an apt description used for the weasely star, although he'd almost definetly try to convince you he was instead "Salt of the Earth" as a former mentor of his has called him. MJF was never told that pro wrestling is "fake". Instead, MJF uses his razor sharp words and cunning intellect to chip away at the psyche of his opponents. Whether it be mocking young gun Brian Pillman Jr and his family's history after his father died, or even exclaiming it would have been better for Darby Allin to take his uncles place in death during a car crash the uncle and nephew were in. MJF's horrible ways have rubbed many wrong, but with his 3x Dynamite Diamond Rings and guarantted future success, the sky is the limit for this generations mega-villain.</div>
            <div class="whitetextthree"><h3>Sammy Guevara</h3> The most controversial of the four pillars from a fan standpoint, Guevara has had an interesting rise and fall in the fans eyes thus far in his career. Guevara, a 3x TNT champion, has made a name for himself fighting a hybrid style, almost like fellow pillars Darby Allin and Jungleboy put together. Guevara loves nothing more than to climb a ladder, remind the fans how loco he is, and create a moment that gets replayed for the next month. Guevara has built a loyal fanbase through his vlogs with the vlog crew as well. Guevara has also seen his fair share of controversy, especially in regards to his relationship with fellow wrestler Tay Conti and their ensuing storyline against Scorpio Sky and the American Top Team. Fans however have clamored for a return to the mean-spirited Guevara, and with Conti at his side we could very well be looking at this generations Edge and Lita.</div>
            <div class="whitetextfour"> <h3>"Jungleboy" Jack Perry</h3> Jungleboy is a fascinating case in regards to the pillars. A workhorse thats near the top of all time wins in AEW history, Jungleboy is a workhorse that loves fighting with his blend of high flying moves mixed with ground and pound offense. As the current tag team champion, Jungleboy has spent a large part of the last year finding his identity. As fans wait for Jungleboy to become a man, the star has gained experience as a tag champ along with Luchasaurus. Fans cannot get enough of Jungleboy and his theme song, as his entire persona has done an amazing job captivating the audience as a face far better than most wrestlers can. As Jungleboy continues to grow up, fans at large have waited for his mentor Christian to turn on the young star. As Jungleboy has shown in the past, he possesses an edge, an edge we may see when he inevitably loses his tag team titles. </div></div>
